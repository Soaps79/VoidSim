## Development

Concepts and tasks can be found in the public [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bT2nHyHK3gr07vE92bUfm1ZlPeioPMD3LhMdtIkSH8o/edit?usp=sharing) and [Trello](https://trello.com/b/UQ94zc9O/spaceport)

## High Concept

You are in command of a spaceport newly commissioned on the frontier of the explored galaxy. Traffic moving through the area has needs, and fulfilling them keeps your coffers flush. Use this income to build factories, commercial structures and attractions to bring commerce, but also to house and feed your population that work in them. Over time, your port and its people will grow alongside and be a lynchpin for the colonies and commerce in the new frontier.

## Core Gameplay

Core gameplay will take place on an outside view of the station, which will eventually be some sort of cutaway view. The player attaches buildings and modules to the station which tie into larger game systems. These systems are monitored and driven by the UI, making it a fairly heavy menu-driven experience.

1. Place facilities to shape the type of traffic
  * Make or refine goods for sale
  * Attract businesses to set up shop
  * Become a hotspot of interplanetary tourism
2. Increase traffic and generate income, which is used to:  
  * Buy and upgrade facilities within the station
  * Purchase goods from other factions to refine to more profitable products
  * Most income is a steady flow, so chains can be set up then provide passively
3. Interact with other Factions through trade
  * Buy and sell goods on the general market
  * Individual trade deals can be proposed. They will provide higher income than the general market, but harsh prices will be paid for non-delivery
  * Special requests can appear, completion of which will improve relationships
4. Interact with the Galaxy
  * Send survey teams to find exploitable materials elsewhere in space
