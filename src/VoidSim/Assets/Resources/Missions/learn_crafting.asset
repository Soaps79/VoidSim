  FlavorText: Pick up a factory (the tall skinny one) in the toolbox on the left,
    and place it on one of the lit up spots on the station. In the crafting window
    that just showed up, set the recipe to Consumer Goods, then turn it On and tell
    it to Buy goods. This factory will keep producing as long as it has materials,
    which it just requested from the outside world.
